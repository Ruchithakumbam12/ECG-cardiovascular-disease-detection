# ECG-cardiovascular-disease-detection
This project focuses on detecting cardiovascular diseases from ECG images using Python-based image processing and machine learning techniques. The system extracts key features from ECG signals and applies classification algorithms to predict potential heart conditions. SQL is used for structured data storage, retrieval, and performance analysis.
